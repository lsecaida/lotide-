- map(...): makes a copy of an existing array
- letterPositions(...): takes in a string and returns all the indices in the string where each character is found.
- findKey(...): scans an object and returns the first key for which the callback returns a truthy value.
- findKeyByValue(...): returns a key from an object when provided with a value as an argument
- eqObjects(...): compares two objects to check for a match
- eqArrays(...): compares two arrays to check for a match
- countOnly(...): return counts for a specific subset of those items
